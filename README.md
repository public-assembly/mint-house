# Mint House

This is a generic [Public Assembly](https://www.public---assembly.com/about) project to showcase the frontend usage of Assembly Press.

To deploy your own version of Mint House, please first review this tutorial on deploying an [Assembly Press Curation Contract](https://forum.public---assembly.com/chat/c/-/77/12524)

To deploy the Mint House frontend you will need a Github account. Additionally you will need API keys from signing up and creating two new projects on [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) for both Goerli and Mainnet usage. This will be two separate projects with two different keys. Retain these values for the following step.

You should then have the following necesary environment variables:

- address of the contract (0x...) in environment variables `(NEXT_PUBLIC_PRESS_ADDRESS)`
- the previous two Alchemy API keys `(NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_MAINNET & NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_GOERLI)`
- your project name `(NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_NAME)`

Once you do, click following Vercel wizard button to get started:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fpublic-assembly%2Fmint-house&env=NEXT_PUBLIC_PRESS_ADDRESS,NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_MAINNET,NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_GOERLI,NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_NAME&envDescription=More%20info%20on%20API%20keys%20needed&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fpublic-assembly%2Fmint-house%2Fblob%2Fdevelopment%2FREADME.md)

Copy and paste the necessary strings to their corresponding values and confirm the deployment.

## Getting Started for Development

Open a terminal and clone your newly created repo to your local environment. Navigate to the cloned directory and run:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

This will get all necessary packages for development.

You will then need to copy .env.example and rename to .env.local and fill in all the same values from the initial deployment steps above.

> Note: You can further customize links, images, socials, etc via `config.js` in the root directory.

Then you can run the development server via:

```bash
npm dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Page routes at [receipt] will automatically be generated by the curation receipts as minted to your Assembly Press contract.

This will autofill the indexed view of all receipts with navigation and the `[receipt]/mint` page where the media details and mint functionlity should populate.

All UI customization is up to you from here, but the base repo uses [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) out of the box and we recommend consulting the docs.
